Question,Ground Truth Answer,
What is crop rotation?,Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area across a sequence of growing seasons to improve soil health and reduce pests.,
What are the main symptoms of rice blast disease?,"Symptoms include spindle-shaped lesions on leaves with gray or white centers and brown margins, and rotting of the neck that can cause the panicle to fall over.",
What is the difference between macronutrients and micronutrients in soil?,"Macronutrients (like N, P, K) are needed by plants in large quantities, while micronutrients (like Zinc, Iron) are needed in very small amounts for healthy growth.",
How does integrated pest management (IPM) work?,"IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests through a combination of techniques such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, and use of resistant varieties.",
What is the purpose of adding lime to soil?,"Adding lime to soil is primarily done to increase soil pH, reducing acidity and making nutrients more available to plants.",
What are the benefits of vermicompost over traditional compost?,"Vermicompost usually has a higher nutrient content, better microbial activity, and improves soil structure faster than traditional thermophilic compost.",
What is a common disease in dairy cattle related to calcium deficiency?,"Milk fever (hypocalcemia) is a common metabolic disease caused by low blood calcium levels, typically occurring around the time of calving.",
Explain the term 'tillage' in agronomy.,"Tillage is the agricultural preparation of soil by mechanical agitation of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning.",
What is the primary function of Nitrogen (N) in plant growth?,"Nitrogen is essential for vegetative growth, causing dark green leaf color and is a major component of chlorophyll and amino acids.",
How can farmers control aphids organically?,"Farmers can control aphids organically by introducing natural predators like ladybugs, using neem oil sprays, or using strong water sprays to dislodge them.",
What is 'drip irrigation'?,Drip irrigation is a type of micro-irrigation system that has the potential to save water and nutrients by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants from above the soil surface or buried below the surface.,
What causes 'wheat rust'?,"Wheat rust is a fungal disease caused by Puccinia species, characterized by reddish-brown pustules on stems and leaves.",
Why is organic matter important in soil?,"Organic matter improves soil structure, increases water-holding capacity, provides nutrients for plants and soil microbes, and helps sequester carbon.",
What is the gestation period for a cow?,"The gestation period for a cow is approximately 283 days, or about 9 months.",
What is a 'cover crop'?,"A cover crop is a plant that is used primarily to slow erosion, improve soil health, enhance water availability, smother weeds, help control pests and diseases, and increase biodiversity.",
What are the signs of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in livestock?,"Signs include fever, blisters in the mouth and on feet, excessive salivation, lameness, and reduced appetite.",
What is urea used for in agriculture?,Urea is widely used in agriculture as a nitrogen-rich fertilizer to promote green leafy growth in crops.,
Define 'agronomy'.,"Agronomy is the science and technology of producing and using plants for food, fuel, fiber, and land reclamation.",
What is the best time to harvest maize for grain?,"Maize for grain should be harvested when the kernels have reached physiological maturity, often indicated by the formation of a 'black layer' at the base of the kernel and moisture content is around 20-25%.",
How does soil salinity affect plant growth?,High soil salinity makes it difficult for plant roots to absorb water (osmotic stress) and can cause toxicity from specific ions like sodium and chloride.,
What is biological pest control?,"Biological control is the use of living organisms, such as predators, parasitoids, and pathogens, to control pest populations.",
What are the advantages of green manuring?,"Green manuring adds organic matter and nitrogen to the soil, prevents erosion, and improves soil aeration.",
What is 'mastitis' in cattle?,"Mastitis is the persistent, inflammatory reaction of the udder tissue in cows, usually caused by bacterial infection, which reduces milk production and quality.",
What is the NPK ratio?,"The NPK ratio represents the percentage by weight of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) in a fertilizer package.",
What is the role of potassium in plants?,"Potassium regulates the opening and closing of stomata, and therefore regulates CO2 uptake, and is essential for the activation of many enzymes.",
